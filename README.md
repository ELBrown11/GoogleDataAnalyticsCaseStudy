# Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

In this case study, I acted as a junior data analyst within the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional company. My assignment involved leveraging data to create a comprehensive report addressing a specific business task. The focal question was: How do annual members and casual riders differ in their usage of bikes? To tackle this, I applied the data analysis process framework, utilizing various tools, software, and programming languages. Drawing on my training in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate courses, I applied the six-step data analysis framework: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Each phase of the execution yielded crucial insights, ultimately providing a comprehensive solution to the business inquiry.
