# Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

In this case study I am a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team using data from the (ficticious) company Cyclistic tasked with producing a report with specific deliverables that solve business task. The business task/question which I was assigned was: **how do annual members and casual rider use bike differently?** 
I employed the data analysis process framework along with different tools/softwares and programming languages to solve the business task. 
Through the courses in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate I learned through the courses I learn about to apply the data analysis process framework to solve a business task.
The framework includes 6 steps: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**. 
The execution of each step enabled me to find key insights for answering the business question.
